# Graphiti MCP Setup Complete âœ…

## What's Been Done

1. **Installed Graphiti MCP Server** 
   - Cloned from https://github.com/getzep/graphiti
   - Installed dependencies with `uv`
   - Created wrapper script at `/Users/lucasrnobrega/Claude-outputs/Scripts e MCPs/graphiti-mcp/run-graphiti-mcp.sh`

2. **Neo4j Database Running**
   - Neo4j 5.26.2 is running in Docker
   - Available at: bolt://localhost:7687
   - Web UI at: http://localhost:7474
   - Username: neo4j
   - Password: password

3. **Configuration Added to MCP**
   - Added `graphiti-memory` server to your MCP configuration
   - Configured with your Zep API key and OpenAI API key

## To Complete Setup

1. **Restart Claude CLI** to load the new MCP configuration:
   ```bash
   # Exit Claude and restart it
   ```

2. **Verify Connection** by running:
   ```bash
   claude --mcp-debug
   ```

3. **Test Graphiti** by asking Claude to:
   - "Add a memory about our Graphiti setup"
   - "Search my memories"
   - "Show me what's in the knowledge graph"

## Available Graphiti Commands

Once connected, you can use these features:
- Episode management (conversations/sessions)
- Entity and relationship creation
- Semantic search through memories
- Group-based organization
- Graph maintenance

## Troubleshooting

If the connection fails:
1. Ensure Neo4j is running: `docker ps | grep neo4j`
2. Check logs: `claude --mcp-debug`
3. Verify the script is executable: `ls -la /Users/lucasrnobrega/Claude-outputs/Scripts e MCPs/graphiti-mcp/run-graphiti-mcp.sh`
